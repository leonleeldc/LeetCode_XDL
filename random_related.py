Given an array of integers arr, randomly return an index of the 
maximum value seen by far.
Example:
Input: [11, 30, 2, 30, 30, 30, 6, 2, 62, 62]
Having iterated up to the at element index 5 (where the last 30 is), 
randomly give an index among [1, 3, 4, 5] which are indices of 30 - the max 
value by far. 
Each index should have a Â¼ chance to get picked.
Having iterated through the entire array, randomly give 
an index between 8 and 9 which are indices of the max value 62.

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of reservoir sampling, 
which is a randomized algorithm for choosing a sample of k items from 
a list S containing n items, where n is either a very large or unknown number. 
Typically used for large or unknown n, the reservoir sampling ensures that 
each item in the list has an equal probability of being chosen.
In our case, we want to return an index of the maximum value 
seen so far in the array. When we encounter a new maximum value, 
we reset our sampling pool (or "reservoir"). If we encounter 
another instance of this maximum value, we add its index 
to the reservoir with an equal chance of picking 
any of the indices in the reservoir.

Here's how you can implement this in Python:
'''
class ReservoirSampling:
    def __init__(self, arr):
        self.arr = arr

    def pickIndex(self):
        max_val = float('-inf')
        reservoir = []
        for i, val in enumerate(self.arr):
            if val > max_val:
                max_val = val
                reservoir = [i]
            elif val == max_val:
                reservoir.append(i)
        return random.choice(reservoir)

528. Random Pick with Weight
You are given a 0-indexed array of positive integers w where w[i] describes the weight of the ith index.

You need to implement the function pickIndex(), which randomly picks an index in the range [0, w.length - 1] (inclusive) and returns it. The probability of picking an index i is w[i] / sum(w).

For example, if w = [1, 3], the probability of picking index 0 is 1 / (1 + 3) = 0.25 (i.e., 25%), and the probability of picking index 1 is 3 / (1 + 3) = 0.75 (i.e., 75%).

Example 1:

Input
["Solution","pickIndex"]
[[[1]],[]]
Output
[null,0]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1]);
solution.pickIndex(); // return 0. The only option is to return 0 since there is only one element in w.
Example 2:

Input
["Solution","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex"]
[[[1,3]],[],[],[],[],[]]
Output
[null,1,1,1,1,0]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1, 3]);
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1. It is returning the second element (index = 1) that has a probability of 3/4.
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 0. It is returning the first element (index = 0) that has a probability of 1/4.

Since this is a randomization problem, multiple answers are allowed.
All of the following outputs can be considered correct:
[null,1,1,1,1,0]
[null,1,1,1,1,1]
[null,1,1,1,0,0]
[null,1,1,1,0,1]
[null,1,0,1,0,0]
and so on.

398. Random Pick Index
Given an integer array nums with possible duplicates, 
randomly output the index of a given target number. You can assume 
that the given target number must exist in the array.
Implement the Solution class:
Solution(int[] nums) Initializes the object with the array nums.
int pick(int target) Picks a random index i from nums where nums[i] == target. 
If there are multiple valid i's, then each index should have an equal probability of returning.
Input
["Solution", "pick", "pick", "pick"]
[[[1, 2, 3, 3, 3]], [3], [1], [3]]
Output
[null, 4, 0, 2]
Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1, 2, 3, 3, 3]);
solution.pick(3); // It should return either index 2, 3, or 4 randomly. Each index should have equal probability of returning.
solution.pick(1); // It should return 0. Since in the array only nums[0] is equal to 1.
solution.pick(3); // It should return either index 2, 3, or 4 randomly. Each index should have equal probability of returning.

  basic idea is from the Reservoir sampling
  1
  1*1/2, 1/2
  1/2*2/3 = 1/3, 1/2*2/3 = 1/3, 1/3
  for Reservoir sampling, suppose we have 10 balls already in a bag, then the 11th ball comes, 
  It has 10/11 prob to enter into the bag, but we need to remove one from the bag. 
  The removed one has 10/11 * 1/10 = 1/11 to be selected. After that, the 11th one has 10/11 prob into the bag.
  similarly, 12th ball comes, the removed one has 10/12 * 1/10 = 1/12 to be sected, the 12th ball has 11/12 prob into the bag, 
  .., N-1/N.
  product them together, 
  we have 1 * 10/11 * 11/12 * N-1/N = 10/N
  So, we can equal prob to be selected to enter into the bag.

138. Copy List with Random Pointer
A linked list of length n is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or null.
Construct a deep copy of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly n brand new nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the next and random pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list.

For example, if there are two nodes X and Y in the original list, where X.random --> Y, then for the corresponding two nodes x and y in the copied list, x.random --> y.

Return the head of the copied linked list.

The linked list is represented in the input/output as a list of n nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of [val, random_index] where:

val: an integer representing Node.val
random_index: the index of the node (range from 0 to n-1) that the random pointer points to, or null if it does not point to any node.
Your code will only be given the head of the original linked list.

2973. Find Number of Coins to Place in Tree Nodes
You are given an undirected tree with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1, and rooted at node 0. You are given a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1, where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.
You are also given a 0-indexed integer array cost of length n, where cost[i] is the cost assigned to the ith node.
You need to place some coins on every node of the tree. The number of coins to be placed at node i can be calculated as:
If size of the subtree of node i is less than 3, place 1 coin.
Otherwise, place an amount of coins equal to the maximum product of cost values assigned to 3 distinct nodes in the subtree of node i. If this product is negative, place 0 coins.
Return an array coin of size n such that coin[i] is the number of coins placed at node i.

Problem Description:
Given a 2D array, we start from the top-left corner and move towards the bottom-right corner. We can move up, down, left, or right. 
The ID of a path is defined as the maximum value within that path. The goal is to find and print the path with the smallest ID among all possible paths. 
One approach that comes to mind is using DFS to traverse all paths and then selecting the result. 
During the interview, the interviewer kept asking if there is a better solution. After some thought and with time constraints, 
I ended up writing the DFS solution. I wonder if anyone has a better solution?
Suggested Solution:
For this problem, a more efficient approach than DFS is to use the Dijkstra algorithm to find a path such that the maximum value within the path is minimized.
Basic Idea:
Initialize the maximum value for all nodes to infinity.
Start from the top-left corner and use a priority queue to conduct a breadth-first search.
When considering moving from one node to another, update the value of the target node to the maximum value seen on the current path.
Once we reach the bottom-right corner, we have found a potential optimal path.
Throughout the process, we use the priority queue to always expand the node with the smallest maximum value.
This approach has a time complexity of O(mn*log(mn)), where m and n are the number of rows and columns in the 2D array respectively.
Below is the Python code using the Dijkstra algorithm for this solution: [followed by the provided code]

994. Rotting Oranges
You are given an m x n grid where each cell can have one of three values:

0 representing an empty cell,
1 representing a fresh orange, or
2 representing a rotten orange.
Every minute, any fresh orange that is 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten orange becomes rotten.
Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. If this is impossible, return -1.
Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
Output: 4
Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]
Output: -1
Explanation: The orange in the bottom left corner (row 2, column 0) is never rotten, because rotting only happens 4-directionally.
Example 3:

Input: grid = [[0,2]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Since there are already no fresh oranges at minute 0, the answer is just 0.
